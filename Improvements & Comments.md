**Improvements & Comments**   
**for Ananas web application** (available at [https://ananas.rs/](https://ananas.rs/))

*Improvement no. 1*  
**Current:** Items “0800000111”, “Piši nam” and “Status porudžbine” are scattered in a small bar at the top.  This small bar is not sticky, and it is not visible on the mobile version. It is visible only on the desktop version.   
**Requested:** Create a new bar below the existing one that contains the search field and the search orange button. Group the items “0800000111”, “Piši nam”, and “Status porudžbine” together in this new bar. Add a tooltip that appears when hovering over the items, providing extra information.  
**Reason:** The items should be more eye-catching and better organized to improve the user experience. Grouping related items reduces cognitive load and improves scannability.

*Improvement no. 2*  
**Current:** There is no label text next to the “Korpa” cart icon  in the sticky bar at the top right corner of the page. The number of selected articles is displayed on the cart.  
**Requested:** Add the label text “Korpa” next to the cart icon. Change the color of the cart if it is not empty (red e. g.). This should be visible on both desktop and mobile versions.   
**Reason:** If there is a label text next to the heart icon, there should also be a label text next to the cart icon. It's essential to unify the elements on the site to help users navigate more easily. The cart icon has high functional value and must be immediately recognizable. A label text next to it improves UX and makes the application more user friendly.

*Improvement no. 3*  
**Current:** Clicking on the label text “Napravi nalog/Prijavi se” opens an authentication form containing a linked text “Registruj se”.  
**Requested:** Change the label text from “Napravi nalog/Prijavi se” to “Registruj se/Prijavi se”.  
**Reason:** Consistent names should be used for the same functions because recognition is always better than recall. 

*Improvement no. 4*  
**Current:** Clicking on the “Inverter klime” item in the bar displays the result. In the filter on the left sidebar, the user can enter minimum and maximum prices. The user is not able to enter prices below the cheapest or above the most expensive product.  
**Requested:** Create options (radio buttons or checkboxes) for price ranges for air conditioners as follows: from 0 to 20,000 dinars, from 20,000 to 30,000 dinars, from 30,000 to 40,000 dinars, and over 40,000 dinars. Clicking on the radio button or checkbox immediately applies the filter.   
**Reason:** It’s easier for users to click on predefined price ranges than to enter the minimum and maximum price for each product every time. This makes the application more user-friendly, reduces effort and supports the user's decision. New users have fewer doubts, so the purchase process is completed faster.

*Improvement no. 5*  
**Current:** Entering “Inverter klime” in a search query causes the application to display results in eight rows, which makes scrolling with the mouse tiring.  
**Requested:** Optimize the search results layout to a maximum of 6 rows. Reduce the space between the product description and the product price.  
**Reason:** Clarity improves UX, making the application easier to use and less tiring for users.

*Comment no. 1 (UI/Design)*  
Entering “Inverter klime” in a search query causes the application to display results in eight rows, which makes scrolling with the mouse tiring. Displaying results in six rows is a better option. The text about air conditioners that currently appears after the search results might be better placed before the results in a shortened version, with a linked text “Vidi više…” next to it.

*Comment no. 2 (Functionality)*  
After entering “Inverter klime” in the search query and viewing the results, I checked the “No” option in the “Wi-Fi” filter. After that, among the applied filter tags, there is a tag that says “Ne”, which causes confusion about what “Ne” refers to. It would be better if the filter tag was labeled “Bez wi-fi funkcija.”
